Completed the project on datacamp utilising Python. Needed to use libraries: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot. Loaded in the csv files then using dataframes 
I transformed the data which was then used to create visualisation to help identify the perfomance of the two athletes. 
I have attached the 2 csv files as well as my code in two different formats. 
My code is attached in the folder "notebook" and is visible as both a html as well as python file.
